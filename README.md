# Pattern Recognition - Project
## Course Project Repository of Online News Popularity 

## Abstract
The analysis on shares and popularity of social media articles is being much and more important for many business evaluations. It involves analysis of very large amount of data which can specifically explain the correlation with the popularity. Considering the problem description of analysis, some feature extraction techniques like PCA, Log transformation are implemented onto the dataset available, to work out and have a comparision. Feature extraction works well with large data, reducing the memory, computation and building up the efficiency of modelling. The work of this project flows as data extraction, data observation, data cleaning, feature extraction (including feature selection) and classification.

## Additional Notes
The implementation of this system is a part of course project (Pattern Recognition)
